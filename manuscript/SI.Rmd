# Supplementary Information


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="400px", fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig_r3} Cumulative secondary extinctions of species resulting from the primary removals of the \\textbf{least connected species} in the ADBM predicted food webs corresponding to the maximum TSS and observed food webs. S denotes the number of species in a food web. The cumulative secondary extinctions of species and the number of species removed have been normalised by the number of species."}

Box represent the 25th and 75th percentile; bold midline represents the median; whisker represents outlier limits; the outlier coefficient used was 1.5. The dashed black lines are the 1:1 relationships for reference."}

Here, $R_{50}$ is the proportion of species that have to be removed to achieve a total loss of at least 50\\% of total species (primary removals and secondary extinctions).
