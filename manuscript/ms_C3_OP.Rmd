# Introduction

## Background on anthropogenic changes and its impact on food web

Anthropogenic changes such as climate change and habitat destruction is a threat to biodiversity, and can lead to food web collapse. Climate change can lead to the collapse of a food web [@ullah2018]. Primary extinctions in a food web can give rise to further secondary extinctions in a food web resulting in collapse of the food web. The impact of this extinction is dependent on the complexity and structure of the food web (reference).

## Briefly explain work done by Jennifer Dunne on food web [OP] robustness to primary extinctions, and also what has been done since, particularly concerning the importance of connectance

Simulation of primary species loss has been conducted in observed food webs and model food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems where robustness was measured in terms of secondary extinctions [@dunne2002network; @dunneCascadingExtinctionsCommunity2009]. These studies showed that the robustness of the food webs increases with food web connectance. When canonical experiments in natural ecosystems are not possible, this provides an alternate solution to investigate the impact of primary extinctions in a food web.

Connectance of a food web plays a key role in determining the robustness of the predicted food webs. 


[OP] Explain (either here or in the methods) difference between topological and abundance (given by dynamics) based criteria for a secondary extinction occurring. 

## [OP] State what is the problem...

A key assumption of this work is that food webs are very well sampled, so that all links that in reality can occur are represented. Yet it is know that not all food webs are very well sampled, and then do not represent all of the feeding links that occur. One solution to this problem is to use a food web model to predict which are the missing links, and to then measure the robustness of the predicted food web. This solution is not fool proof, however, as it is likely that the food web model is not perfect, and so may still miss some links, and also may predict some links that could not, in fact occur.

## In previous work...

In previous work we made predictions of food web structure using the allometric diet breadth model (ADBM, [@beckerman2006; @petchey2008]) fit to empirical data using ABC. (ADBM uses foraging theory specifically the contingency model [@macarthur1966] to predict the diet of each potential consumer and thereby the food web structure.) A key finding of this work was...  overestimated the food web connectance when compared with the observed connectance. [State interpretation]: false positives, false negatives. In that work there was no attempt to estimate the importance of these findings for food web robustness to extinctions.


## What we do in this study

It is crucial to investigate the implication of this overestimation in the robustness of predicted food webs. We expect that the ADBM predicted food webs would be more robust as compared to the observed food webs, and for the greater robustness to be related to the amount by which the ADBM overestimates connectance. In this study, we simulate primary species loss in 12 food webs predicted from the ADBM to quantify the secondary loss of extinctions. We use three different approaches of species removal: (i) most connected species, (ii) random species and (iii) least connected species to understand if the outcome varies among these approaches.

## Allometric Diet Breadth Model (ADBM)

The allometric diet breadth model (ADBM) is based on optimal foraging theory, specifically the contingency foraging model [@macarthur1966]. The ADBM predicts the set of prey species a consumer should feed upon to maximise its rate of energy intake [@petchey2008]. The foraging variables in the model: energy content of the resources, handling times of the prey, space clearance rate and prey densities are allometrically scaled to the body sizes of the species. 

## Food web data

The observed food webs that we fit the ADBM to belong to marine, freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems (Table \ref{fig:tab_1}). The observed connectance of these food webs is from 0.03 to 0.24 and there are 29 to 239 species. The food webs contain primary producers, herbivores, carnivores, parasites, and parasitoids. They also contain various types of feeding interactions, including predation, herbivory, bacterivory, parasitism, pathogenic, and parasitoid.

      caption = "\\label{fig:tab_1}Information about the food webs predicted using the ADBM.", escape = FALSE, align = "l") %>%

  column_spec(7, width = "8em") %>%
  column_spec(8, width = "8em") %>%
  column_spec(9, width = "8em")
  
  
```

## Primary and secondary extinctions

We implemented the primary species removal method from @dunneCascadingExtinctionsCommunity2009 by sequentially removing species using one of three criteria: removal of (i) the most-connected species, (ii) the least-connected species and (iii) randomly chosen species. The most-connected and least-connected criteria are based on the degree (i.e. total number of links to resource and links from consumer for each species) of species. Given a primary removal if any remaining species lost all of their resource species, or any cannibalistic species lost all of their resource species except the cannibalistic links, they are dropped from the web and were recorded as a secondary extinction. Then the next appropriate species are removed determining the most- and least-connected species based on the web remaining after all prior primary removals and secondary extinctions had occurred. This process was carried out until all species were extinct from the web.

## Calculating robustness

Robustness (R) of food web was quantified as the proportion of species subjected to primary removals that resulted in a total loss (i.e. primary removals plus secondary extinctions) of some specified proportion of the species. In our study, we use $R_{50}$, the number of primary extinctions divided by the total number of species, that result in at least 50 per cent of total species loss [@dunne2002network; @dunne2004; @dunneCascadingExtinctionsCommunity2009]. Therefore, there is no secondary extinction in a maximally robust community ($R_{50} = 0.50$), whereas in a minimally robust community ($R_{50} = 1/S$) there is extensive secondary extinctions (i.e. at least $S/2 - 1$).

# Results



## Show and describe the secondary extinction curves

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="500px", fig.cap="\\label{fig:fig_r1} Cumulative secondary extinctions for 12 food webs across different ecosystems."}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/plot_dd_mc_mod.png")
```

## Show and describe the following:

I suggest to focus on the relationship between (difference in robustness between observed and predicted food web) and (difference in robustness between the observed and predicted food web).

Show differences between the methods.

Mention the outlier food webs: where the stability of ADBM predicted food webs is lower than empirical food webs

## Explain the robustness plots

[OP] I'm not too sure what is meant by this.

### Compare the results from the different methods


# Discussion

## [OP] Briefly summarise the findings

...

## What does overestimation of connectance imply in terms of stability?

...

Include here the possibility that the increased connectance would influence dynamical stability, and state if and why this may increase or decrease stability.

## Discuss how the robustness is dependent on the TSS of the predicted food web

* Would a higher TSS imply a higher difference in the robustness between predicted and observed food web?

OP: This (TSS and robustness relationship) would need to be presented in the Results, if this is to be included.

## Compare the results from our study with results from other food web models (Jennifer A. Dunne and Williams (2009))

[OP] Including if and why we expect our findings to be replicated with those other models. Include some of Gravel and Poissot's models


## Explain that the ADBM can only predicts contiguous diets [OP] and the implications of this

...

## Future prospect of using a dynamical model to model the temporal dynamics of the ADBM predicted food web

Need to coordinate this content with what I proposed on line 141.
